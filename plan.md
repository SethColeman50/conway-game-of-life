# Conway's Rules

- <= 1 and full dies
- >= 4 and full dies
- 2 full or empty nothing
- 3 and empty populate

## Ideas

- Graphical representation like project one
- loop to figure out update and then loop to update grid
  - deal with edges
- Send all neighbors with cell in cuda version
- debug mode
- from jeff, 9 digit binary index that represents the current 3x3 and a giant const list that acts as a lookup table
