Conway's Rules
- <= 1 and full dies
- >= 4 and full dies
- 2 full or empty nothing
- 3 and empty populate

Ideas
- Graphical representation like project one
- loop to figure out update and then loop to update grid
    - deal with edges
- Send all neighbors with cell in cuda version
- Probably easy to do rectanguler matrices
